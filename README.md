# Britannica
"# FullStack_test_Agular_nodeJs" 

    (please download full site here and npm install it with node moduls - for client folder and server folder too

 

notes:


you will need to create a DB from mongo with this information :  (im using robo 3T)

the website is running on a DB called britanniceDB, so you will have to create a DB with this name --->  britannicaDB


than load the mongoDB node database and run it 

the server side is connected to a local mongodb database 




 *** the DB will have two collections. ***


first collection is -   notes  -   for the purpose of using documents (notes) that are created in this form -


structure:

{
   
    "authorname" : "sharonpinto-123@hotmail.com",
    "content" : "text texttext texttext texttext text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text ",
    "date" : "19/10/2021",
    "__v" : 0
}



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


the second collection is - users - for the purpose of tthe website  log in - authorizations


a user - is created as a document like this - 


structure:
{
   
    "email" : "amircabili@hotmail.com",
    "age" : "123123123"
}


when the server is running you can run the client too 


and see that is all working
